Polymorphism 
   When 2 different classes share the same function name

Note: When talking about polymorphism is not guaranteed, 
that they inherit from the same class, or that they 
follow the same interface.

class Knight:
    def move(self):
        return "Knights move in an L" 

class Bishop
    def move(self):
        return "Bishops move along a diagonal"
