# Implement a RequestBatcher class that batches individual network requests to improve throughput.
# The class should:
# 
# Accept individual requests via a submit(request) method
# Batch requests together when possible to reduce network overhead
# Ensure no request waits more than max_delay_ms milliseconds
# Limit batch sizes to max_batch_size
# Return futures/promises that resolve when the individual requests complete
# 
# Your implementation should optimize for:
# 
# Reduced number of network calls
# Minimal latency for individual requests
# Proper error handling and propagation
# 
# Example usage:
# batcher = RequestBatcher(max_batch_size=100, max_delay_ms=50)
# future = batcher.submit(my_request)
# result = future.get()  # Blocks until request is complete
