# Implement a function `process_batch` that simulates processing a batch of tasks in parallel.
# 
# The function takes:
# - tasks: List of task IDs (integers)
# - num_workers: Number of available worker threads
# - process_time: A function that returns the processing time for a given task ID
# 
# Your function should:
# 1. Distribute the tasks among workers optimally to minimize total completion time
# 2. Return the total time to complete all tasks and which worker processed each task
# 3. Handle the case where there are more tasks than workers
# 
# Example:
# Input: tasks = [1, 2, 3, 4], num_workers = 2, process_time(task_id) returns [10, 5, 7, 8]
# Output: (15, {1: [1, 2], 2: [3, 4]}) # Total time: 15, Worker 1 processes task 1, Worker 2 processes tasks 2, 3, and 4
